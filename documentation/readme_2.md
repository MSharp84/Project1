Open the file you just created in your favourite text editor, if on windows find the file with file explorer or use finder if on mac. Make whatever changes you would like, maybe write a bit about what the program does. Once you are happy with the changes, and they are final save the file, you are now ready to merge them back to the main branch. In this case, the changes are inconsequential, in a real-world scenario you would probably be making changes to the code.
